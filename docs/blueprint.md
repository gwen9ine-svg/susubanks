## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#38A3A5) to represent growth and financial stability. This will also create strong contrast in a light scheme.
- Background color: Light green (#E8F5F4), a very pale tint of the primary to give a calm, secure impression.
- Accent color: Soft teal (#57C4E5), a lighter color that provides subtle contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) to maintain a balance of modern and approachable.
- Use flat, minimalist icons related to finance and community, with consistent styling. Icons should use the primary color or accent color.
- Use a consistent two-column layout for navigation and content. Employ cards with rounded corners and subtle shadows to organize and highlight key data points. Ensure responsiveness for mobile devices.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions for user interactions. Highlight value increases, new messages or important user actions using short animation effects. These animations should not distract from the key page elements.
